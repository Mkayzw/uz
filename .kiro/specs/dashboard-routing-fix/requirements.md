# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has a dashboard routing issue where users are not being properly directed to the correct dashboard based on their role after authentication. Users are experiencing failures when trying to access their dashboard, likely due to profile data loading issues and improper role-based routing logic. The system needs to reliably route users to the appropriate dashboard (tenant, agent, or admin) based on their profile data and handle error states gracefully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want to be automatically routed to the tenant dashboard after successful authentication, so that I can access tenant-specific features without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with role 'tenant' successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the tenant dashboard view
2. WHEN the tenant dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display tenant-specific navigation tabs (overview, browse, applications, saved, account)
3. IF profile data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a retry mechanism and not redirect to login
4. WHEN profile data is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL persist the user session and maintain dashboard state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an agent user, I want to be automatically routed to the agent dashboard after successful authentication, so that I can manage my properties and applications efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with role 'agent' successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the agent dashboard view
2. WHEN the agent dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display agent-specific navigation tabs (overview, properties, applications, commission, account)
3. IF the agent status is not 'active' THEN the system SHALL display appropriate status messages and limited functionality
4. WHEN agent profile data loads successfully THEN the system SHALL show agent-specific data and features

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to be automatically routed to the admin dashboard after successful authentication, so that I can manage system operations and user verifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with role 'admin' successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the admin dashboard at /admin
2. WHEN the admin dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display admin-specific functionality for managing payments and agents
3. IF a non-admin user tries to access /admin THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the home page
4. WHEN admin authentication is verified THEN the system SHALL load admin-specific data and interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As any user, I want clear error handling and recovery options when dashboard loading fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message explaining the issue
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide a retry button and not automatically redirect to login
3. IF authentication expires during dashboard use THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh gracefully
4. WHEN errors are recoverable THEN the system SHALL provide clear action buttons for retry or alternative paths
5. IF profile creation fails for new users THEN the system SHALL attempt to create a default profile and retry

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user returning to the application, I want my dashboard state to be preserved and load quickly, so that I can continue where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user returns to the dashboard THEN the system SHALL restore their previous tab selection if valid
2. WHEN the dashboard initializes THEN the system SHALL use cached profile data when available to reduce loading time
3. IF the user was redirected from another page THEN the system SHALL restore the intended destination after authentication
4. WHEN session validation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain user state without unnecessary re-authentication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a new user, I want my profile to be automatically created with appropriate defaults, so that I can access the dashboard immediately after signup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user signs up THEN the system SHALL create a profile with role 'tenant' as default
2. IF profile creation fails during signup THEN the system SHALL retry profile creation on dashboard access
3. WHEN a profile is created THEN the system SHALL set appropriate default values for agent_status and other fields
4. IF user metadata is available THEN the system SHALL populate profile fields from authentication metadata
